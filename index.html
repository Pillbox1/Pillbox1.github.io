        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am on the cusp of graduating from a comprehensive 2-year software development program at Mohawk College. This program has equipped me with a solid foundation in various aspects of software development, including front-end and back-end technologies, data structures, algorithms, and more. 
        
            Prior to this, I spent two decades in the sales industry, honing my communication, negotiation, and problem-solving skills. However, during the COVID pandemic, I decided to pivot towards a career in software development. This decision was driven by my passion for technology and my desire to continually learn and grow.
        
            Outside of my professional life, I am an avid sports enthusiast. I particularly enjoy playing baseball in the summer months. I also take pleasure in watching a variety of sports, which not only serves as a leisure activity but also helps me understand the dynamics of teamwork and strategy.
        
            I am excited to leverage my unique blend of experience in sales and newly acquired skills in software development to make a meaningful impact in my next role.
